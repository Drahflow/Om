\defgroup om__operand__ Operand
	\ingroup om__program__
	\brief
		A \ref om__program__ element that wraps a \ref om__program__.
	\par Interpretation
		A \ref om__program__ is interpreted as an \ref om__operand__ by treating only the first operand (a \ref om__program__ enclosed by braces) as significant.
	\par Normalization
		A \ref om__program__ is normalized as an \ref om__operand__ by discarding all elements other than the first operand element.
	\par Implementation
		Om::Operand
