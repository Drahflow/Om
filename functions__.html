<h1><a class="anchor" id="functions__prefix__"></a>
Prefix Notation</h1>
<p>Om uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">prefix notation</a>: functions read their inputs from the right. Prefix notation has the following advantages over postfix notation typical of concatenative languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack underflows are impossible.</li>
<li>Prefix notation more closely models function composition. Instead of storing a data stack in memory, the Om evaluator stores a composed partial function.</li>
<li>The evaluator can read, parse and evaluate the input stream in a single pass, sending results to the output stream as soon as they are evaluated. This cannot be done with a postfix, stack-based language because any data on the stack must remain there as it may be needed by a function later.</li>
<li>Functions can be optimized to only read into memory the data that is required; stack-based postfix languages have no knowledge of the function to apply until the data is already in memory, on the stack.</li>
<li>Incoming data, such as events, become simple to handle at a language level: a program might evaluate to a function that acts as a state machine that processes any additional data appended to the program and transitions to a new state, ready to process new data.</li>
<li>An integrated development environment can provide hints to the user about the data that is expected by a function.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="functions__input_and_output__"></a>
Input and Output</h1>
<p>A function takes the remainder of the program as input and returns a program as output, pulling elements from the front of the input program and pushing elements to the back of the output program.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="functions__terms__"></a>
Terms</h1>
<p>Only <em>terms</em> (operators and operands) are significant to functions; separators are discarded from input, and are inserted between output terms in a "normalized" form (for consistent formatting and proper operator separation). Therefore, only input and output terms are relevant in describing a function.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="functions__types__"></a>
Types</h1>
<p>There are three fundamental types of functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Identity:</b> A function that pushes all input terms onto the output program.</li>
<li><b>Constant:</b> A function that pushes a term defined by the function, followed by all input terms, onto the output program.</li>
<li><b>Operation:</b> A function that is named by an operator and defines a computation. An operation processes input operands as data for the computation, and pushes any terms generated by the computation onto the output program, until one of two things happens:<ul>
<li>If the computation is completed, the rest of the input terms are pushed onto the output program.</li>
<li>If the computation cannot be completed (due to insufficient operands), the operator that names the operation is pushed onto the output program, followed by all remaining input terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="functions__evaluation__"></a>
Evaluation</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="functions__programs__empty__"></a>
Empty Program</h2>
<p>The empty program evaluates to the identity function.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="functions__programs__single__"></a>
Single-Element Programs</h2>
<p>Programs that contain only a single element evaluate to functions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Separator:</b> Evaluates to the identity function.</li>
<li><b>Operand:</b> Evaluates to a constant function that pushes the operand, followed by all input terms, onto the output program.</li>
<li><b>Operator:</b> Evaluates to the operation defined for the operator in the environment. If none, evaluates to a constant function that pushes the operator, followed by all input terms, onto the output program.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="functions__programs__multiple__"></a>
Multiple-Element Programs</h2>
<p>Programs that contain multiple elements can be considered a concatenation of sub-programs that each contain one of the elements. Om is a <a href="http://concatenative.org">concatenative</a> language: the concatenated program evaluates to the composition of the functions that each sub-program evaluates to.</p>
<p>For example, program "A B" is the concatenation of programs "A", " ", and "B". The separator evaluates to the identity operation and can be disregarded. The programs "A" and "B" evaluate to functions which will be denoted as <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, respectively. The input and output are handled by the composed function as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function <code>B</code> receives the input, and its output becomes the input for function <code>A</code>.</li>
<li>Function <code>A</code> receives the input, and its output becomes that of the composed function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any programs may be concatenated together; however, note that concatenating programs "A" and "B" without an intervening separator would result in a program containing a single operator "AB", which is unrelated to operators "A" or "B".</p>
